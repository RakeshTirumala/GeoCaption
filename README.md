# GeoCaption

GeoCaption is an AI system designed for intelligent captioning of aerial imagery, utilizing a multi-model approach. This system generates descriptive captions for remote sensing images, achieving 60% accuracy on training data and 40% on test data.

## Overview

GeoCaption employs the following models:

- **DenseNet201**: Acts as an encoder to extract features from remote sensing images.
- **LSTM**: Functions as a decoder to generate coherent captions based on the extracted features.

## Features

- **Intelligent Captioning**: Generate descriptive captions for aerial imagery.
- **Multi-Model Approach**: Utilizes DenseNet201 and LSTM models for feature extraction and caption generation.
- **Performance Metrics**: Achieved 60% accuracy on training data and 40% on test data.
